## 📝 Description

This is a flashcard game that runs through the CLI. You will be quizzed about various topics related to Javascript and are graded at the end. The main learning goal of this project was practicing Test Driven Development to develop applications. Through working through this, I realized that not every part of the application can, nor should, be tested. This project uses Mocha, Chai, Node.js, npm, and Javascript.

## 🛠️ Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:KojinKuro/flashcards-starter.git
npm install
npm run test
node index.js
```

## ✨ Feature

- Play flashcards
- Get a time for how fast you completed the game
- Grades player
- Keyboard controls

## 🔍 Context

This project was created during my 8th week of a 28 week program at Turing School of Software and Design. This project developed by myself and took around 5 hours to complete. The largest part of my time was spent planning and writing tests.

## 🎓 Learning Goals

The main goals of this project was to focus on implementing a program following Functional Programming, and adding Test Driven Development.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Add a way to add custom cards easier to the game
- Create a report card for how well the player did and how tries each question took
- Allow users to only review wrong cards instead of resetting everything.
- Allow users to pick which kind of cards to chose from at the start
